# AutoTunes

An automatic music generation engine built with PyTorch! Currently, it only produces single-track music and has only really been tested with S-NES and GameBoy music.

For instructions on how to use, I recommend reading the attached Jupyter Notebook. The code itself has also been heavily documented, so you may feel free to read that.
